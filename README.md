Workspace for Radii physics engine

This is where I will work on my 3d engine and eventually publish under this name.

traditional gpu/rendering ---> raytracing ----> physics/"wave energy" engine.

tbh, what I noticed is that backlighting on traditional displays is static. most objects are lit "dark" IRL and overly bright when rendered. Perhaps something similar to HDR is needed. Other theory that I found is wave forms collapsing into particles ("radii") when observed. So this would be something like waves collapsing/being rendered when observed. guyessing it will be procedurely generated within a given area.
